    <p>Hi, I'm Jia Liang and thank you for visiting my personal website.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer based in Singapore and I've spent most of the past 4 years creating beautiful websites and
      applications. I specialise in full-stack web development (.NET and JavaScript stack) but have also worked on
      projects involving mobile application development and graphical programming.

    <p>
      During my free time I enjoy reading about random topics on the Internet as well as making cool stuff like this
      website. I also occasionally contribute to the anime community by performing translation and image editing work.
      Recently, I've been learning how to create vector-based digital art.
